![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/whatsapp-http-api.png)

On the Internet you can find many articles where you can “make a WhatsApp bot in 5 minutes”, but they are more ads than helpful articles. To keep using these solutions you either will have to pay every month or you have to be a large business (to use official WhatsApp HTTP API) and (have a monthly subscription) pay every month.

We’ll use WhatsApp HTTP API (that is essentially just an HTTP wrapper around the best language-specific library for WhatsApp).
