On the Internet you can find many articles where you can “make a WhatsApp bot in 5 minutes”, but they are more ads than helpful articles. To keep using these solutions you either will have to pay every month or you have to be a large business (to use official WhatsApp HTTP API) and (have a monthly subscription) pay every month.

We’ll use [WAHA](https://waha.devlike.pro/) - WhatsApp HTTP API that you can configure in a click, free and open source version!
